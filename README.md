This project is an interactive Credit Risk Prediction web app built using Python, Streamlit, and Machine Learning. The model predicts whether a customer is likely to default on a credit card payment based on financial, demographic, and behavioral attributes.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

Sourced and preprocessed a credit risk dataset from Kaggle.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, correlations, and outliers.

Conducted feature engineering to improve model performance and interpretability.

Built and compared multiple machine learning models including:

ðŸŒ² Random Forest Classifier

ðŸŒ³ Extra Trees Classifier

âš¡ XGBoost Classifier (achieved highest accuracy)

Developed an end-to-end Streamlit app where users can input customer data and instantly get a credit risk prediction.

ðŸ§© Tech Stack

Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost)

Streamlit (for interactive web UI)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Joblib (for model persistence)

ðŸš€ Key Features

Interactive input fields for user data

Real-time credit risk prediction

Model comparison and evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curve)

Clean UI with color-coded risk output

ðŸ“ˆ Results

XGBoost outperformed other models with the highest overall accuracy and stability.

Feature importance analysis highlighted key factors influencing credit risk.
